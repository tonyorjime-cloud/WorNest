# Tasks — How it works

## Key concepts
- A **Task** is work to be done.
- An **Assignment** links the task to one or more staff.
- A task has:
  - **Title**
  - **Due date**
  - **Days allotted** (used for performance calculations)

## What you should do
### View your tasks
Go to **🗂️ Tasks & Performance** and filter to **My tasks**.

### Complete a task
1. Open the task
2. Mark it **Completed**
3. Add a short completion note if needed

Your **days taken** is recorded and feeds performance.

## Reminders
Reminders are designed to be helpful, not noisy:
- **Due soon**
- **Due today**
- **Overdue escalation** (if enabled by admin)

If you’re on approved leave, reminders should be suppressed for that period.

# Passwords — Staff guide

## Change your password
1. Go to **⚙️ Account**
2. Enter your **current password**
3. Enter your **new password** and confirm
4. Click **Update password**

## Password rules (simple v1)
- Minimum length: **4 characters** (we can raise this later)
- Use something you can remember but others can’t guess.

## If you forget your password
Right now, password reset is **admin-assisted**:
- Contact admin to reset your password (they can set it back to `fcda`).

(If you want self-service “Forgot password”, we can enable it next.)
